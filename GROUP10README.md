Grading Level:

Same grade for all members

Differences:
-----------------------------
The settings page was not completed, as we prioritized functionality and quality of consumer experience. The settings page was originally intended to be minimal, as the user experience is centered around the simple use of various functionality within the app, not profile customization as a settings page would offer.

Note: We intend to continue developing this app and publish it on the App Store within the next semester, in which we will of course include a settings/ profile page.

Special Instructions:

- Minimum CocoaPods version 1.3.1
