Grading Level:
-----------------------------
Same grade for all members

-----------------------------
Differences:
-----------------------------
Instead of implementing ability to create meal plans and workouts, we elected to implement each necessary screen and functionality of the app. We focused more on structure and connectedness of the app, and will scale features like creating meal and workout plans for beta release.

Special Instructions:
-----------------------------
- Minimum CocoaPods version 1.3.1
